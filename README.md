First of all you will need to have social network account (facebook, twitter, etc), after you login successfully you can fully moderate the quiz. From here you can add your own categories or questions for your participants. You have full freedom to edit the quiz the way you like. Now when the quiz is set up, the system will generate URL where the quiz could be accessed. Next thing you will do is to send URL to your participants and the quiz can start.
